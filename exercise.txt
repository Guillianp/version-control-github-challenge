What is the major difference between Git and Github?Git is a version 
control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code 
history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage 
Git repositories.

Why do we use Github? Github is used for several reasons. One of them is 
the ability to make changes to your code without changing the website. 
It also allows for collaboration between team mates. You can also save 
your work in repositories and tap into and find solutions from other 
developers.
